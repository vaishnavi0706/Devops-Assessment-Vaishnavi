1. CrashLoopBackOff – Wrong Command:  
During deployment, the backend pod kept restarting and did not become ready. Upon checking the deployment YAML, we found that the command was set as `["python", "main.py"]`, but the backend application file is actually named `app.py`. We fixed this issue by updating the command in `backend-deployment.yml` to `["python", "app.py"]`. After this change, the backend pod started successfully.

2. Ingress Route Failure:
Requests to the backend through the Ingress were failing. The Ingress was routing requests to `/backend`, but the backend service listens on the `/api` path. We corrected the Ingress path in `app-ingress.yml` from `/backend` to `/api`. After this change, requests reached the backend successfully.

3. Terraform Backend Error:  
While initializing Terraform, we encountered an error related to the remote backend. The cause was that the container name was missing in the `backend.tf` file, fixed this by specifying the correct container name and region  in the backend configuration. Terraform was then able to initialize and apply the infrastructure without errors.

4. FluentBit Log Path Bug:  
Logs from pods were not appearing in Kibana. Upon investigation, we found that FluentBit was configured to read log files with the path `*.logx`, which is incorrect.Updated the FluentBit configuration to read logs from `/var/log/containers/*.log`.
